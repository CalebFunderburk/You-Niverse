# Youniverse

## About this App

### Description

Youniverse is a REST API built using NoSQL for any business to use for their social media platform's back end.

### User Story

As a front-end developer looking for a back-end for my social media website, I would like an application that allows me to interact with other users on my platform, as well as create my own network of users. When I run the application, I am then able to add, read, edit, or delete data from the database.

### Features

* This application comes fully equipped with unique user creation, user created thoughts, and the ability for users to react to each others thoughts.
* This project is ready to be integrated into any JavaScript MVC Social Media application.

## Installation

In order to run this program you will need to:

* Clone this repository to receive all the files.

## Requirements

- Code editor (Visual Studio Code is recommended)
- Command line terminal (GitBash, PowerShell, Terminal, etc.)
- Testing suite (Insomnia is recommended)
- Most recent version of Node.JS
- Most recent version of MongoDB
- Mongoose ODM
- Node packages used in the project
- Clone the Youniverse project file onto your machine

## How to Use

After gathering the necessary tools mentioned above, open the Youniverse project folder in your code editor. At this time, open your command line and navigate to the root directory of this application. From here, type 'npm i' to install all dependencies used in this application. Next, type 'npm start' to initialize and sync the MongoDB server. Once the server has started, you should be able to use a testing suite of your choice to test the routes offered by our API.
